* **Grading and attendance policy** 
    * Be as specific as possible particularly with group projects.
    * You can reference one of [my syllabi](http://deangela.gitbooks.io/ms-thesis-in-digital-media/content/dm997X_ms_thesis_syllabus.html) as a guide only. You can change your policies to suit your class.
* **5% IDM coursework documentation using wordpress on http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu**
    * Add 5% to your grading section for coursework documentation (so that means you'll need to subtract 5% from one of your other grading categories) 
    * We would like all IDM students to document their core, coursework on the sites.bxmc.poly.edu website for archival purposes for all of their courses.
    * Students can get web server space by making an appointment with Elton Kwok, eltonkwok@nyu.edu, MAGNET 883
